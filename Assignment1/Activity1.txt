Hi, my name is Laiba Ekram. I am taking this course because I am doing Associates in Applied Science In Information Technology and this course is my field requirement.
I am really passionate about y field and I want to be successful. I feel like computer is very interesting field and once we understand logics, it will become easier. 
I have already took one class before in which we used Github so I have a little bit knowledge of using github. I am really excited to learn more new stuff in this class 
and get more knowledge.
